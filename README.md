# Hexapawn
writting hexapawn in c++ was one of my first game i ever made and i plan to come back every december of every year to rewrite the  game in a much better way to show myself how far i have been though development, so far i have done only two versions, lets see if i will continue lol

26-07-2025: well i have been busy haha, so no december updated, but i finally tried it again and made it exactly how i imagined it the first back in 2019, 6 years. this time with all the visuals and and graphics i wanted to have, have i become a game devloper? i wonder how far i am gonna go from here, will i look at this version too and be like damn this code is shit, took me around 16 hrs ig, i had to learn c++ again hahaha ;)
